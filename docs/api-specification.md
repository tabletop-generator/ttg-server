# Tabletop Generator Server Specification

## 1. API Version

This is the first version of the Tabletop Generator API, and all URL endpoints discussed below begin with the current version: `/v1/*`. Defining such a version gives flexibility to change the API at a later date, while still supporting older versions in parallel.

## 2. Authentication

Most API routes discussed below require either [Basic HTTP credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication), or a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) to be sent along with each request in the Authorization header.

## 3. Responses

Most responses from the API are returned in JSON format (`application/json`) unless otherwise specified.

Responses also include an extra `status` property, which indicates whether the request was successful (i.e., `'ok'`) or produced an error (`'error'`).

### 3.1 Example: successful response

Successful responses use an HTTP `2xx` status and always include a `"status": "ok"` property/value:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

If a response includes other data, it will be included along with the `status`, for example:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "collection": {
    "id": "30a84843-0cd4-4975-95ba-b96112aea189",
    "ownerId": "11d4c22e42c8f61feaba154683dea407b101cfd90987dda9e342843263ca420a",
    "created": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
    "updated": "2021-11-02T15:09:50.403Z",
    "name": "My Collection",
    "visibility": "public",
    "assets": [
      "30a84843-0cd4-4975-95ba-b96112aea189",
      "40a84843-0cd4-4975-95ba-b96112aea189"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Example: error response

Error responses use an appropriate HTTP `4xx` (client error) or `5xx` (server error), and include an `error` object, which has both the error `code` (a `number`) and a human readable error `message` (a `string`).

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "invalid request"
  }
}
```

## 4. API

### 4.1 Health Check

An unauthenticated `/` route is available for checking the health of the service. If the service is running, it returns an HTTP `200` status along with the following body:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "githubUrl": "https://github.com/tabletop-generator/ttg-server",
  "version": "version from package.json",
  "hostname": "the host computer's domain name"
}
```

### 4.2 Assets

#### 4.2.1 `POST /assets`

Generates an asset for the current user (i.e. authenticated user). The asset parameters are used to fill in prompts and send an API call to the image and text generation APIs. The generated image and other asset data are stored. A presigned URL for the image is created and stored along with it's expiration timestamp.

A successful response returns an HTTP `201`. It includes a `Location` header with a full URL to use in order to access the newly created asset, for example: Location: https://ttg-api.com/v1/assets/30a84843-0cd4-4975-95ba-b96112aea189. See https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30.

If no assets are found, an empty array is returned instead of an error.
